1. Security & Compliance
Real OTP Integration: Currently, the system uses a hardcoded 123456 OTP. Integrating a real SMS service (like Twilio, MSG91, or TextLocal) would secure the loan entry and closure processes.
PII Encryption: Sensitive data like Aadhaar numbers are currently stored in plain text. In a professional system, these should be encrypted at the database level.
Audit Logging: Implementing django-simple-history to track every change made to a loan or customer profile, ensuring a full paper trail for financial audits.
2. Financial Logic & Automation
Automated Interest Daily Tasks: Instead of calculating interest "on-demand" when a page is visited, use Celery + Redis to automatically calculate and update interest for all active loans daily at midnight.
Support for Multiple Interest Regimes: Refactor the interest logic into a "Strategy Pattern" to easily support different schemes (e.g., monthly compounding, daily simple interest, or grace period variations).
3. Reporting & Business Intelligence
Bulk Export Tools: Add a report generator that produces CSV/Excel exports for accountants (e.g., "Monthly Interest Accrual Report" or "Yearly Closed Loans Summary").
Professional PDF Invoices: Expand the existing receipt logic to generate high-fidelity PDF invoices for minden interest payments using libraries like WeasyPrint.
4. User Experience (UX) Enhancements
WhatsApp/SMS Notifications: Automatically send a WhatsApp message to the customer when a payment is recorded or when interest is approaching a capitalization date.
Advanced Customer Search: Implement a more powerful search (e.g., using PostgreSQL Full-Text Search) with "type-ahead" suggestions as the user enters a mobile number or name.
Would you like me to start on any of these, or is there another specific area you'd like to focus on?
